# The project
The starting project was to create an integration capable of importing the remote controls created on Smart Life via the Tuya IR hubs into Home Assistant.

# Project freeze
At the moment, Tuya does not allow control of non-standard IR devices (category 999), probably due to a bug. Theoretically devices with a different category should work.
But since the integration was supposed to eliminate the creation of scenes in the SmartLife app to manage remote devices from Home Assistant, this is not possible with this problem.
The project was suspended because it was inconclusive.
